# What is this post?

In this long post, I mainly talk about contents from many machine learning classes that I have learned such as CS 229 by Prof. Andrew Ng. at Stanford and classes at Columbia taught by Prof. John Paisley, Prof. David Blei, and Prof. Daniel Hsu. This post mixes contents from all of them, and is expected to grow more. It is much like self-disciplined. I always try to cature the most important contents here. This post is supposed to be the marterial for self-study. 

# Why this post?

The key difference of this post is that:

1) I am trying to explain theorectical concepts in plain language and try to give the proof for theorem. I am a student,too. I will try to make it from student's perspectives. 

2) I am trying to make this post to be a good summary for CS 229 and other ML classes. Every class has its own beauty. Putting them together and making a story can make it the most beautiful. 

# How to use it?

You can directly go to any topic you like. Feel free to comment at the bottem of each post. I love to discuss these topics from different perspectives. Also, feel free to let me know if anything is wrong here. 

It is recommended that you have some basic knowledge about probability, linear algebra and vector calculus before reading the notes. The reading can be done simply from beginning to ending or be indexed from left sidebar based on your needs. 

# How to track it?

One way is that you can bookmark this page. I will update this page to show where I have made changes of the notes and what might be coming next. 

The other way is that you can follow my github and click watch button for the repo named wei2624.github.io. I will give formal comments in push when I made some important changes to this post. 

# Found error or interested in other topics?
