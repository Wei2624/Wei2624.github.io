# What is a pointer?

In general of C++ and C, we initialize a variable as:

```cpp
int var = 10;
```

This will have a variable called **var** with a value 10 stored in. What happens inside is that it will first reserve space for an integer and then assign 10 to that memoty block. If we want to know the address of the memory, we should do

```cpp
&var
```

This will give you the address of **var**. However, this is inconvenient if we want to share the value in **var** with someone else in which we have to copy the value every time that we want to share. The simple way is to share the address of that variable. 

Pointer is the variable to hold the address of a variable. 

# How to use a pointer?

you can initialize a pointer in c++ based on the format:

```
typeName* ptr;
typeName* ptr = new typeName();
```

Either way works. For example, we can have:

```cpp
int* ptr;
int* ptr = new int();
```

What happens here is that we just initialize an **int** type **point**, which is the address of a memory block on stack. We haven't assigned any value to that memory. To assign a value:

```cpp
*p = 10;
std::cout << *p << "\n";
```

By using the asterisk sign, we can access the content on the memory block. We can then print the value in console, which outputs 10 in this case.

# How to intialize an object pointer?

Object pointer is basically a pointer that points to an object. The initialization is similar in this case. 

```cpp
Foo* ptr = new Foo ();
Foo* ptr2 = new Foo;
```

Both will create an object of class **Foo** in heap (dynamic memory). Ptr or ptr2 will point to that object. If **Foo** is a Plain Old Data, this will automatically intialize to some random vlaue. Common POD variable type is int, float, double and etc. in c++. 

Note that this is different to :

```cpp
Foo foo;
Foo foo = Foo::Foo();
```

Both will jsut create a **foo** object of **Foo** type in automatic memory block using default constructor. The memory is released once the object goes out of scope. 

# Pointer scope

Imagine that in a function, we have:

```cpp
Foo* ptr = new Foo();
```

When function exits, the **ptr** will be gone from stack automatically. However, the object that **ptr** points to will stay on heap and become bad memory. You have no chance to delete them. This is sometimes called memory leaks issue. 


# Memory leaks

In C or C++, if you allocate some space in memory, you are responsible for releasing the memory once it is done. Otherwise, it will create memory leaks. That is, no one is able to access to that memroy in the duration of program anymore. It becomes bad memory. 

Thus, we should delete our pointer after we are done with it. For example, we can do:

```cpp
int *ptr = new int(10);
delete myPointer; 
// Then do something else
*myPointer = 11; 
```

Note that we should first delete pointer contents and then we can do something else with it. 

Let's look at some bad examples:

```cpp
Bar* bar = new Bar ( *new Foo() );
Bar* bar2 = new Bar ( *new Foo );
```

Both are bad examples because the initialized pointers in the bracket are not deleted and cannot be deleted anymore. Then, we have memory leaks. 

The correct way to do it is:

```cpp
Bar* bar = new Bar ( Foo::Foo() );
Bar* bar = new Bar ( new Foo() );
```

Both are valid syntax and will not cause memory leaks. 

Note that in C++, we can use **smart pointers** to avoid from memory leaks.
