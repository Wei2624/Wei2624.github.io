My name is Wei Zhang(in Chinese: 张威). I am a graduate student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), working with Professor [John Paisley](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/). I am also a member of [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I obtained my B.S. in Electrical Engineering of Honours, Co-operative Program from [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Canada, where I worked with Professor [Xuemin(Sherman) Shen](http://bbcr.uwaterloo.ca/~xshen/). I then obtained my M.S. in Electrical Engineering of Honors Program from Columbia University, where I worked with Professor [Shih-Fu Chang](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/) and Professor [Peter Allen](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/). 

My research interests are Bayesian machine learning and deep learning, robot learning, computer vision and precision medicine. **Feel free to contact me for collaboration opportunity if you are also interested in those fields.**
